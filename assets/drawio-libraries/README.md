# Draw.io Icon Libraries

Local Azure architecture icon libraries for draw.io diagram generation.
Icons are base64-encoded SVG data URIs embedded in `mxlibrary` XML format
for fully offline operation.

## Regeneration

To regenerate icon libraries from the latest Microsoft Azure icon pack:

```bash
# 1. Download the latest Azure Public Service Icons ZIP from:
#    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons/
#
# 2. Run the conversion pipeline:
python tools/scripts/convert-azure-icons-to-drawio.py <path-to-zip>
```

## Usage in Diagrams

Icons are referenced in draw.io via the `image` style property with a
`data:image/svg+xml;base64,...` data URI. The simonkurtz-MSFT Draw.io MCP
server includes its own 700+ icon library; these local libraries are for
the VS Code Draw.io extension and manual diagram editing. Each icon snippet in `icons/`
contains a complete `.drawio` XML file with a single image cell that
agents can copy into their diagrams.

### Agent Icon Discovery Protocol

1. Read `azure-icons/reference.md` to find the icon name → filename mapping
2. Load the icon snippet from `azure-icons/icons/{filename}.xml`
3. Copy the `mxCell` element (id="2") into the target diagram
4. Adjust `x`, `y` coordinates and optionally `width`, `height`

### Loading Libraries in draw.io Desktop/Web

Open draw.io → File → Open Library → select a category `.xml` file.
