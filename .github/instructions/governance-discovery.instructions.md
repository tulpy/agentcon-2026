# Governance Discovery Instructions

**CRITICAL**: Governance constraints MUST come from the live Azure environment —
either directly through `discover.py` during the current run, or indirectly
through the approved scheduled workflow baseline generated from live Azure and
committed under `.github/data/governance-policy-baseline.json`.
**GATE**: This is a mandatory gate. If Azure connectivity fails or policies
cannot be retrieved during live discovery, STOP and inform the user.
Do NOT generate governance constraints from assumptions.
Do NOT accept arbitrary static files as governance input — only the approved
workflow output file (`.github/data/governance-policy-baseline.json`) is valid
for cached baseline mode.

## Why This Matters

Assumed governance constraints cause deployment failures. Example:

- **Assumed**: 4 tags required (Environment, ManagedBy, Project, Owner)
- **Actual**: 9 tags required via Azure Policy
- **Result**: Deployment denied by Azure Policy

**Management group-inherited policies are invisible to basic queries.**
Use REST API (not `az policy assignment list`) to capture all inherited policies.

## Discovery Is Delegated to Subagent

Discovery runs inside an isolated subagent invoked via `#runSubagent`. The
subagent:

1. Verifies Azure connectivity via ARM token
2. Queries ALL policy assignments via REST API (including MG-inherited)
3. Drills into Deny/DeployIfNotExists definitions to verify actual impact
4. Classifies effects and returns a structured report

The authoritative output contract is defined in
[`tools/schemas/governance-constraints.schema.json`](../../tools/schemas/governance-constraints.schema.json).

> **DO NOT** read the subagent's `.agent.md` file into the parent agent's
> context. Doing so defeats context isolation and causes the parent to execute
> the subagent's internal script inline instead of delegating. Treat the
> subagent as opaque — interact with it only via `#runSubagent`.

## Fail-Safe: If Discovery Fails

If the subagent returns PARTIAL or FAILED status:

1. **STOP** — Do NOT proceed to implementation planning
2. Document the failure in the governance constraints file
3. Mark all constraints as "UNVERIFIED - Query Failed"
4. Add warning: "GATE BLOCKED: Deployment CANNOT proceed"
5. **Do NOT generate assumed/best-practice policies as a fallback**

## Deep Reference

For policy effect decision trees, plan adaptation examples, validation
checklists, anti-patterns, and file format schema, read:
`.github/instructions/references/governance-discovery-reference.md`

## Downstream Enforcement

Discovered policies do not stop at documentation — they MUST flow through
to the Code Generator and review subagent:

1. Code Generators (Phase 1.5) read `04-governance-constraints.json`
   and build a compliance map before writing any code
2. Review subagents verify every Deny policy constraint is satisfied
3. Both require `bicepPropertyPath`, `azurePropertyPath`, and
   `requiredValue` fields in the JSON for programmatic verification

See `.github/instructions/references/iac-policy-compliance.md` for the
full enforcement mandate.
