# SKU Manifest Authoring Rules

`agent-output/{project}/sku-manifest.{json,md}` is the single source of
truth for creative SKU decisions across environments and regions. The
JSON is canonical; the markdown is a rendering for human review.

Schema: `tools/schemas/sku-manifest.schema.json`
Validators: `npm run validate:sku-manifest` + `npm run validate:sku-iac-coverage`
Templates: `.github/skills/azure-artifacts/templates/sku-manifest.template.{md,json}`

## Scope — what belongs in `services[]`

**In scope** (creative SKU decisions only):

- App Service Plans / Web Apps / Function Apps
- Virtual Machines / VM Scale Sets (VMSS)
- SQL Database / Managed Instance
- Cosmos DB accounts and containers (where throughput is a SKU)
- AKS node pools (per-pool VM SKU)
- Redis Cache
- API Management
- Application Gateway
- Storage Account replication tier (LRS/ZRS/GRS/RA-GRS)

**Out of scope — never add to `services[]`** (the explicit exclude list):

- Bandwidth / egress
- Log Analytics workspaces
- Virtual networks, subnets, NSGs, route tables
- Public IP addresses
- Diagnostic settings
- Resource groups, management groups, subscriptions
- Action Groups, Budgets, Policy assignments

These remain documented in `02-architecture-assessment.md` prose or in
the implementation plan narrative. The coverage validator
(`validate:sku-iac-coverage`) treats SKU literals in these resource
categories as legitimate non-manifest entries.

## Revision Rules

`revisions[]` is append-only metadata about git commits / apex-recall
checkpoints — **not** a free-form changelog.

- `rev` starts at 1 and increases monotonically.
- `current_revision` always equals the max `revisions[].rev`.
- Each service's `last_modified_rev` must reference an existing
  revision.
- `commit_sha` is stamped post-commit by
  `tools/scripts/stamp-sku-manifest-commit.mjs` (wired via
  `lefthook.yml post-commit`).
- `apex_recall_checkpoint` is set by the writer before commit. Pattern:
  `{project}:{step}:{sub_step}`.

## Source Provenance

`services[].source` is one of:

- `user-pin` — Step 1 (Requirements). Captured via the mandatory Phase 3j
  SKU/sizing preference elicitation (see
  [Mandatory Elicitation at Step 1](#mandatory-elicitation-at-step-1)).
  Never auto-changed by downstream agents. If a planner/deploy step
  needs to alter a user-pin SKU, escalate to Architect via the
  `step-N → step-2` return edge.
- `architect-derived` — Step 2 (Architecture). Chosen by `03-Architect`
  from priced `candidate_sets[]`. May be revised at Step 4 (Planner)
  for governance reconciliation; revision keeps `source: architect-derived`.
- `deploy-substitute` — Step 6 (Deploy). Substituted by `07b`/`07t`
  during the block-with-escalation pre-flight when quota/region capacity
  forces a change. Always paired with an entry in
  `decisions.sku_overrides[]`.

`source_step` records when the entry was first created.

## Lifecycle (per `00-session-state.json` `decisions.sku_manifest_status`)

| Status      | Set by            | Meaning                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| (empty)     | —                 | Manifest not yet created                                                                               |
| `draft`     | `02-Requirements` | Rev 1 written. Phase 3j SKU/sizing elicitation complete; `decisions.sku_preferences_captured = true`. |
| `reviewed`  | `03-Architect`    | Rev 2 written with architect-derived entries                                                           |
| `locked`    | `05-IaC Planner`  | Rev 3 reconciled with governance findings                                                              |
| `deploying` | `07b`/`07t`       | Pre-flight quota/region check started                                                                  |
| `deployed`  | `07b`/`07t`       | Deployment succeeded                                                                                   |
| `drift`     | `08-As-Built`     | `actual_sku` differs from planned `size`                                                               |

## Mandatory Elicitation at Step 1

`02-Requirements` MUST elicit SKU and sizing preferences from the user
for every project, regardless of complexity, workload pattern, or whether
the user has any pins. The elicitation is the Phase 3j batched
`askQuestions` call defined in
[`service-class-menu.md` § 3j](../skills/azure-defaults/references/service-class-menu.md#3j-sku-and-sizing-preferences-mandatory-for-every-project).

Outcomes:

- Any **Pinned SKU/size** or **Tier floor** answer is written to
  `services[]` with `source: "user-pin"`, `source_step: "1"`,
  `last_modified_rev: 1`. Tier floors land in `notes` plus a
  representative `size`.
- **No preference** answers do not create manifest entries; Architect
  fills them in at Step 2 with `source: "architect-derived"`.
- After Phase 3j completes (regardless of pin count), the writer records
  `decisions.sku_preferences_captured = true` via
  `apex-recall decide`. This flag distinguishes "user opted out of every
  pin" (valid) from "agent skipped the elicitation" (validator-blocked).

An empty `services[]` at rev 1 is valid **only** when
`decisions.sku_preferences_captured = true` is set. The validator may be
tightened to enforce this; until then, missing flags trigger a WARN.

## Block-with-Escalation Pattern (Step 6)

When a pre-flight quota or region SKU check fails:

1. Surface to human via the orchestrator. Include available substitutes
   from `azure-quotas` skill.
2. Human responds with one of four `sku_conflict_resolution` enum
   values:
   - `revert_to_plan` — restart deploy with original SKU after quota fix
   - `accept_substitute` — accept the substitute SKU
   - `change_region` — redeploy to a different region
   - `abort` — abandon the deployment
3. After **N=3** orchestrator round-trips with no acceptable substitute,
   surface `abort` as an explicit option to break deadlock.
4. On resolution, append one entry to `decisions.sku_overrides[]`
   (array — never dynamic keys) and write a new manifest revision with
   `source: "deploy-substitute"`.

## Feature Requirements (`requires[]`)

`services[].requires[]` lists feature dependencies the SKU must
support. Cross-checked at Step 4 by `05-IaC Planner`. Common entries:

- `vnet-integration` — App Service ≥ Standard (S1+); not on Basic.
- `private-endpoints` — Storage Account GPv2 (not v1); SQL DB ≥ Standard.
- `managed-identity` — supported by most modern Azure services; flag
  legacy SKUs that don't.
- `zone-redundant` — requires `zonal: true` and region with AZ support.
- `customer-managed-keys` — premium tiers only on most services.

Unmet `requires[]` → `must_fix` finding at Step 4 adversarial review.

## Per-Environment Overrides

`services[].environment_overrides.{env}` is a **sparse map**. Include
only fields that differ from the base entry. Common patterns:

- `dev`: smaller `size`, `capacity.mode: "fixed"`, `zonal: false`,
  `commitment: { type: "on-demand" }` (no reserved capacity).
- `test`: usually identical to dev or one tier up.
- `prod`: matches base entry (no override needed) OR upgrades
  `commitment` to a reserved instance.

The `environments[]` top-level set is the allowlist. Override keys
outside this set are a validator error.

## Coverage Rules

`validate:sku-iac-coverage` checks both directions:

- **Manifest → IaC**: every `services[].iac_logical_names.{bicep|terraform}`
  must appear in `infra/{bicep|terraform}/{project}/` source.
- **IaC → manifest**: every effective SKU (explicit literals **plus**
  AVM module defaults when the consumer doesn't pass a SKU param) must
  trace back to a manifest entry — unless the surrounding resource
  matches the exclude list above.

AVM-default resolution is wired through
[`tools/scripts/_lib/avm-default-skus.mjs`](../../tools/scripts/_lib/avm-default-skus.mjs).
Add a row to that table when a new AVM module ships with a default SKU.

## Rollout

Both validators are **hard-fail**. There is no warn-only window.

Legacy projects that predate the manifest may opt out by placing a
`.sku-manifest.skip` sentinel file in their `agent-output/{project}/`
directory; the coverage validator will then skip-with-info instead of
erroring. Remove the sentinel once the project has a real manifest.

## Governance Allowlist Projection

`04g-Governance` derives a normalized SKU allowlist projection from
`04-governance-constraints.json` after Phase 2 by invoking
`node tools/scripts/derive-sku-allowlist.mjs <project>`. The script
walks `findings[]` for `effect: "deny"` entries whose
`azurePropertyPath` ends in `.sku.name` / `.skuName` / `.sku_name` /
`.vmSize`, maps `resource_types[]` to canonical service names, and
writes the projection into the manifest's `sku_allowlist_snapshot`
(allowed_skus + denied_skus, pattern-matched with `*`/`?` globs).

`validate:sku-manifest` cross-checks every `services[].size` against
the projection. The derive script is idempotent — re-running it on
unchanged input is a no-op.

## Pricing Freshness + Manifest Staleness

`validate:sku-manifest` emits WARN when:

- `services[].cost_estimated_at` is older than `APEX_SKU_PRICING_TTL_DAYS`
  (default 30 days). `cost-estimate-subagent` writes both
  `cost_estimate_monthly_usd` and `cost_estimated_at` atomically via
  Mode B writeback, so this warning indicates pricing should be
  refreshed.
- The manifest's top-level `updated_at` is older than
  `APEX_SKU_MANIFEST_TTL_DAYS` (default 90 days).

These thresholds are env-tunable for projects with different cadence.

## Multi-Stamp Manifests

Optional `stamps[]` field at the manifest top level represents
independent deployments of the same workload (per-tenant, per-region
overlays). Each stamp has:

- `id` (unique within `stamps[]`)
- `regions[]` (may differ from `default_region`)
- optional `environments[]` (subset of top-level `environments[]`)
- optional `service_overrides` (map of `services[].id` → sparse
  `envOverride` shape, applied on top of base entry + env override)

The validator checks `id` uniqueness, environment subset, and that
`service_overrides` keys reference real `services[].id` entries. When
`stamps[]` is absent the manifest behaves as a single-stamp project.

## MD ↔ JSON Sync

The companion `sku-manifest.md` is a **deterministic rendering** of
`sku-manifest.json`, produced by
[`tools/scripts/render-sku-manifest-md.mjs`](../../tools/scripts/render-sku-manifest-md.mjs).

**Rules**:

- Agents write **JSON only**. The renderer is the only legitimate writer
  of `sku-manifest.md`. Hand-editing the MD is forbidden and will be
  overwritten on the next commit (lefthook pre-commit auto-stages the
  re-rendered MD).
- After any rev-N JSON mutation (Architect at Step 2, Planner at Step 4,
  Deploy at Step 6, As-Built at Step 7), the author MUST run
  `node tools/scripts/render-sku-manifest-md.mjs <project>` and stage
  the MD change in the same commit.
- The renderer is idempotent: running it twice on the same JSON yields
  byte-equal output.
- `validate:sku-manifest` hard-fails when MD is missing, its "Current
  revision" Overview cell is absent, or that cell does not equal the
  JSON's `current_revision`. Re-render to fix.

CI enforcement: a `.github/workflows/*` job runs the renderer and
`git diff --exit-code` on `**/sku-manifest.md` — the PR fails if MD
drifted out of sync with JSON.
