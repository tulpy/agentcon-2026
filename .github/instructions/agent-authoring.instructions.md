# Agent Authoring Standards

---

## Agent Definition Standards

These instructions apply to custom agent definition files (for example: `.github/agents/*.agent.md`).

Goals:

- Keep agent behavior consistent and predictable across the repo
- Avoid drift between agents and the authoritative standards in `.github/instructions/`
- Prevent invalid YAML front matter and broken internal links

### Front Matter (Required)

Each `.agent.md` file MUST start with valid YAML front matter:

- Use `---` to open and close the front matter.
- Use spaces (no tabs).
- Keep keys simple and consistent.

Recommended minimum fields:

```yaml
---
name: { Human-friendly agent name }
description: { 1-2 sentences, specific scope }
tools:
  - { tool-id-or-pattern }
handoffs:
  - { other-agent-id }
---
```

For the complete frontmatter field reference (all supported keys, types, defaults),
see `.github/instructions/references/agent-file-structure.md`.

#### `name`

- Clear, human-friendly display name.
- Keep it stable (renames can confuse users and docs).

#### `description`

- Describe what the agent does, and what it does NOT do.
- Mention any required standards (WAF, AVM-first, default regions) if applicable.
- **MUST be a single-line inline string** — NOT a YAML block scalar (`>`, `>-`, `|`, `|-`).
  Block scalars break VS Code prompts-diagnostics-provider and silently degrade discovery.

#### `tools`

- List only tool identifiers that are actually available in the environment.
- Prefer patterns when supported (for example: `azure-pricing/*`, `azure-mcp/*`).
- If the agent should not call tools, set `tools: []` explicitly.
- Use `agent` (not `agent/runSubagent`) as the tool ID for subagent delegation.
- For long tool lists, prefer multi-line YAML arrays for readability:

```yaml
tools: [read/readFile, edit/createFile, agent, "azure-mcp/*"]
```

#### `argument-hint`

- Optional hint text shown in the chat input field to guide users.
- Keep it short and action-oriented (for example: `Describe the Azure workload you want to deploy`).

#### `agents`

- List agent names available as subagents (must match `name` from target agent's frontmatter).
- Use `*` to allow all agents, or `[]` to prevent any subagent use.
- If `agents` is set, the `agent` tool MUST be included in `tools`.
- **Override rule**: Explicitly listing an agent in `agents` overrides that agent's
  `disable-model-invocation: true`. This lets coordinator agents access protected subagents.

#### `handoffs`

- Use `handoffs` to connect workflow steps (for example: Architect -> IaC Plan -> Bicep Code).
- Only reference agents that actually exist in the repo.
- Use Title Case for the `agent` value matching the agent's display `name` (from frontmatter).
  For example: `agent: Architect` (matching `name: Architect` in frontmatter).
- Do not set `model` on individual handoff entries unless the target agent requires a specific
  model that differs from the agent's own frontmatter `model` value.

> **Schema note:** VS Code Copilot's handoff schema permits only
> `label`, `agent`, `prompt`, and the optional `send`,
> `showContinueOn`, `model` properties. Any other property (including
> `kind:`) is flagged as "Unknown property" by the editor. Workflow-
> handoff validation derives the relationship to the DAG structurally
> from `(label, agent)` instead of relying on an inline taxonomy
> field — see `.github/skills/workflow-engine/references/handoff-validation-rules.md`.

#### `user-invocable`

- Boolean (default `true`). Controls whether the agent appears in the agents dropdown.
- Set to `false` for subagents that should only be called by other agents.

#### `disable-model-invocation`

- Boolean (default `false`). Prevents the agent from being invoked as a subagent by other agents.
- Use when an agent should only be directly user-invoked, never delegated to.

#### `model`

**Model selection is intentional and must not be changed without explicit approval.**

**Source of truth:** the agent's frontmatter `model` field is canonical. The
[`tools/registry/agent-registry.json`](../../tools/registry/agent-registry.json) entry
mirrors it (verified by `validate-model-consistency.mjs`). The
[`.github/model-catalog.json`](../model-catalog.json) file is documentation only —
it records authorized models and intended use cases but is **not** enforced by any
validator. To change a model, update the agent frontmatter first, then mirror the
change in the registry.

**Frontmatter form:**

- Agents (`*.agent.md`): array form — `model: ["Claude Opus 4.7"]`
- Prompts (`*.prompt.md`): string form — `model: "Claude Opus 4.7"`
- Registry JSON: string form — `"model": "Claude Opus 4.7"`

**Do not** use the YAML bareword form (e.g., `model: Claude Opus 4.7`) when a
label contains parenthetical qualifiers — YAML misparses parens and breaks
frontmatter loading. Always quote (or use the array form for agents).

Agents that specify `Claude Opus 4.7` as priority model do so deliberately:

- **Opus-first agents** (requirements, architect, iac-plan, context-optimizer)
  use `Claude Opus 4.7` for architecture decisions, WAF assessments, planning
  accuracy, and complex analysis. Reasoning effort is a per-agent policy (see
  "Reasoning-effort policy" below) — not encoded in the model label.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6 agents** (design, bicep codegen, terraform codegen,
  as-built, plus the four IaC validation/preview subagents `bicep-validate`,
  `bicep-whatif`, `terraform-validate`, `terraform-plan`): Anthropic prompting
  style (XML-tagged blocks, `<context_awareness>`, `<output_contract>`,
  `<scope_fencing>`, role-first, checklist-driven structured output) suits
  ADR + diagram authoring, AVM-first IaC code generation with verbatim
  invariant retention, the structured PASS/FAIL findings produced by the
  validation subagents, and the checklist-driven Step 7 as-built artifact suite.
  Default Sonnet 4.6 effort is `high`; the Design agent, both CodeGen agents,
  as-built, and the four subagents pin effort to `medium` for typical work and
  only raise it for large change sets.
- **GPT-5.5 agents** (orchestrator fast path, governance,
  challenger wrapper, challenger-review-subagent, deploy (Bicep + Terraform),
  diagnose, e2e-orchestrator)
  use the OpenAI GPT-5.5 prompting style: explicit Role / Personality / Goal /
  Success / Constraints / Output / Stop sections, retrieval budgets, decision rules
  over absolutes, and stopping conditions. GPT-5.5 reasons more efficiently than
  predecessors — re-evaluate `low`/`medium` reasoning effort before escalating
- **GPT-5.4 mini agents** (orchestrator) use the same GPT-5.x prompting style
  as the GPT-5.5 cohort (per vendor-prompting `family-support.md` — GPT-5.4
  shares the OpenAI cohort rules). Lower-cost tier suits handoff-only routing
  with no creative generation.
- **GPT-5.3-Codex subagents** handle narrow, high-throughput tasks (cost estimation)

#### GPT-5.5 prompting style (summary)

The migrated GPT-5.5 cohort follows the OpenAI GPT-5.5 prompting guide:

- Outcome-first body skeleton: `Role` → `Personality` (user-facing agents only) →
  `Goal` → `Success criteria` → `Constraints` → `Output` → `Stop rules`.
- Existing required sections (`output_contract`, security baseline, workflow
  contracts, examples) stay verbatim — the skeleton wraps them, it does not
  replace them.
- Constraints replace ALWAYS/NEVER absolutes with scoped decision rules; gate
  enforcement language and security-baseline language stay verbatim.
- Personality blocks are present only on the user-facing Orchestrator and
  Orchestrator (Fast Path); internal pipeline agents (CodeGen, Governance,
  Challenger, subagent) get no personality block — output contracts rule.
- Reasoning effort defaults to the Copilot runtime default; do not request
  `high` reflexively.

| Cost estimate subagent              | GPT-5.3-Codex     | High-throughput pricing                  |

#### Reasoning-effort policy

Reasoning effort is a **per-agent** policy, not a model-label suffix. The
catalog records one entry per Anthropic SKU (`Claude Opus 4.7`,
`Claude Sonnet 4.6`); whether an agent runs at default or high reasoning
effort is documented in this section and inferred from the agent's role:

- **High effort** — Requirements, Architect, IaC Planner, Context Optimizer.
  These agents tackle creative, multi-artifact decisions where extra
  reasoning produces measurably better outcomes (WAF trade-offs, plan
  accuracy, deep audits). Sonnet-tier agents pin to `medium` for typical work
  and only escalate for large change sets.
- **Default effort** — Diagnose. The interactive approval-first GPT-5.5 flow
  alternates short reasoning bursts with user confirmations, so deep multi-step
  deliberation per turn would just slow the flow without improving accuracy.
- **Effort tuning is a per-call concern** — Copilot Chat / VS Code respects
  the user's per-turn reasoning-effort selector and any harness-level
  override. The policy above is the project's recommended default; no
  validator enforces it. If you change an agent's effort policy, update this
  table and the agent's body if the body explicitly references effort.

**Source-of-truth chain:**

- Agent frontmatter is canonical (`.github/agents/**/*.agent.md`).
- The agent registry mirrors frontmatter (enforced by
  `validate-model-consistency.mjs`).
- The model catalog (`.github/model-catalog.json`) authorizes labels via its
  hand-maintained `models` block and mirrors the canonical assignments via
  its auto-generated `assignments` block (enforced by
  `validate-model-catalog.mjs`).
- The `assignments` block is regenerated by
  `node tools/scripts/generate-model-catalog.mjs` and refreshed automatically
  by the lefthook pre-commit hook whenever an agent frontmatter file is
  staged.

**Rules:**

1. **Never reorder models** to put a speed-optimized model before Opus if Opus is currently first
2. **Planning accuracy trumps cost/speed** — incorrect plans waste more resources than Opus costs
3. When adding `model` arrays, match the pattern of similar workflow-stage agents
4. Document any model changes in PR description with justification

### Agent Hierarchy

#### Top-Level Agents

Top-level agents live in `.github/agents/` and are `user-invocable: true`. They correspond to
the multi-step workflow:

| Step | Agent                | File                             |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1    | Requirements         | `02-requirements.agent.md`       |
| 2    | Architect            | `03-architect.agent.md`          |
| 3    | Design (optional)    | `04-design.agent.md`             |
| 4    | IaC Plan             | `05-iac-planner.agent.md`        |
| 5b   | Bicep Code           | `06b-bicep-codegen.agent.md`     |
| 6b   | Bicep Deploy         | `07b-bicep-deploy.agent.md`      |
| 5t   | Terraform Code       | `06t-terraform-codegen.agent.md` |
| 6t   | Terraform Deploy     | `07t-terraform-deploy.agent.md`  |
| 7    | As-Built             | `08-as-built.agent.md`           |
| —    | Orchestrator         | `01-orchestrator.agent.md`       |
| —    | Diagnose             | `09-diagnose.agent.md`           |
| —    | Challenger (wrapper) | `10-challenger.agent.md`         |

#### Subagents

Subagents live in `.github/agents/_subagents/` and are `user-invocable: false`. They isolate
expensive or specialized work from their parent agent's context window.

| Subagent                      | Parent Agent        | Purpose                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `challenger-review-subagent`  | All workflow agents | Adversarial review (comprehensive + rotating lenses) |
| `cost-estimate-subagent`      | Architect           | Pricing MCP queries                                  |
| `bicep-validate-subagent`     | Bicep Code          | Lint + AVM/security code review                      |
| `bicep-whatif-subagent`       | Bicep Deploy        | `az deployment group what-if`                        |
| `terraform-validate-subagent` | Terraform Code      | Lint + AVM-TF/security code review                   |
| `terraform-plan-subagent`     | Terraform Deploy    | `terraform plan` change preview                      |

Subagent definition rules:

- Set `user-invocable: false` — subagents are never called directly by users.
- Set `agents: []` — subagents do not chain to other agents.
- Keep tool lists minimal — only the tools needed for their specific task.
- Use `GPT-5.3-Codex` as the default model for fast, isolated execution.
- Return structured results (PASS/FAIL, APPROVED/NEEDS_REVISION, etc.) so the parent
  agent can act on the verdict without parsing free-form text.

#### Deprecated: `infer`

The `infer` field is deprecated. Use `user-invocable` and `disable-model-invocation` instead.
If any agent still uses `infer`, migrate it to the new fields.

### Shared Defaults (Required)

All top-level workflow agents in `.github/agents/` MUST read the `azure-defaults` skill for shared
knowledge. Include a reference near the top of the agent body:

```text
Read `.github/skills/azure-defaults/SKILL.md` FIRST for regional standards, naming conventions,
security baseline, and workflow integration patterns common to all agents.
```

### Research Before Implementation

All agents gather context before producing output. This ensures complete, one-shot execution
without missing context or requiring multiple iterations.

Pre-implementation checklist:

1. Search the workspace for existing patterns (`agent-output/`, similar projects, templates).
2. Read relevant templates in `.github/skills/azure-artifacts/templates/`.
3. Query documentation via MCP tools (Azure docs, best practices) where applicable.
4. Confirm all required artifacts from previous workflow steps exist.
5. Check shared defaults in `.github/skills/azure-defaults/SKILL.md`.
6. Proceed only when you have sufficient context to produce a complete artifact.

Use read-only tools first — `semantic_search`, `grep_search`, `read_file`, `list_dir`, and the
Azure MCP tools — to build understanding before making changes. When extensive research is
needed, delegate to a subagent and instruct it to work autonomously and return findings without
pausing for user feedback.

Rules: research before creating files; read templates before generating output; query Azure docs
before recommending services; validate inputs before proceeding to the next step; ask for
clarification when context is insufficient rather than assuming.

### Subagent Delegation Pattern

When an agent delegates work to a subagent, follow this pattern:

1. **Prepare inputs** — compile the data the subagent needs (resource list, file paths, etc.)
2. **Delegate** — call the subagent with a clear prompt containing the inputs
3. **Receive structured result** — the subagent returns a verdict/report
4. **Integrate** — use the subagent's output in the parent agent's artifact

**Context isolation**: Subagents don't inherit parent instructions or conversation
history. They receive only the task prompt. Pass all required context explicitly.
VS Code can run multiple subagents in parallel when tasks are independent.

### Authoritative Standards (Avoid Drift)

When an agent outputs a specific document type, it MUST treat these as authoritative:

- Cost estimates: `.github/skills/azure-artifacts/references/cost-estimate-standards.md`
- Workload docs: `.github/skills/docs-writer/references/workload-documentation.md`
- Markdown style: `.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md`
- Bicep: `.github/instructions/iac-bicep-best-practices.instructions.md`

If an agent contains an embedded template in its body, it MUST match the relevant instruction file.

### Templates in Agent Bodies

- Prefer short templates that are easy to keep aligned with standards.
- If you include fenced code blocks inside a fenced template, use quadruple fences (` ```` `)
  for the outer fence to avoid accidental termination.
- Keep example templates realistic, but do not hardcode secrets, subscription IDs, or tenant IDs.

### Body Content Guidelines

- The agent body is **prepended to every user chat prompt** — keep it concise to preserve
  context window budget.
- Use `#tool:<tool-name>` to reference tools in body text (the official VS Code syntax).
- Prefer plain Markdown over decorative formatting:
  - **Bold** (`**text**`) is effective for emphasis — the model responds to it.
  - `> [!CAUTION]` / `> [!IMPORTANT]` callouts render on GitHub but have no special
    behavior in the agent runtime. Use bold headings instead to save tokens.
  - Emoji prefixes (`✅`, `❌`) on list items are redundant when the list is already
    under a `### DO` / `### DON'T` heading. Omit them.
  - Step breadcrumb lines (e.g., `requirements → architect → [design] → ...`) duplicate
    the `description` field. Omit them.

### Links

- Prefer relative links for repo content.
- Verify links resolve from the agent file's directory (relative paths in Markdown are file-relative).
- Avoid linking to files that don't exist.

### Writing Style

- Use ATX headings (`##`, `###`).
- Keep markdown lines <= 120 characters.
- Use tables for decision matrices, comparisons, and checklists.

### Quick Self-Check (Before PR)

- `tools:` uses `agent` (not the deprecated `agent/runSubagent`) for subagent delegation
- `tools:` only contains valid tool IDs/patterns
- `handoffs:` only references real agents (including As-Built for Step 7)
- Handoff entries do not redundantly set `model` when the target agent already defines it
- The `azure-defaults` skill reference is correct
- Subagent files set `user-invocable: false` and `agents: []`
- Embedded templates match `.github/instructions/*` standards
- `npm run lint:md` passes

---

## Context Hygiene (Token Efficiency)

These rules apply to every primary agent. They preserve quality while
cutting wasted tokens — duplicate reads, sequential prompts that could be
batched, and verbose frontmatter that the router doesn't need.

### No-duplicate-read rule

> A file in your conversation history is already loaded. Never call
> `read_file` on a file you (or a subagent in the same session) have
> already read. If you need its content again, re-use the earlier tool
> result — the model retains it.

The most expensive duplicates we've observed:

| Path | Typical cost per duplicate |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/skills/azure-defaults/SKILL.md` | ~1.25k tokens |
| `.github/skills/azure-artifacts/SKILL.md` | ~1.25k tokens |
| `.github/skills/workflow-engine/SKILL.md` | ~1.25k tokens |
| `.github/skills/azure-artifacts/templates/*.template.md` | ~1.25k each |

When an agent body says "Read X" but X may already be in history, prefer:
"Read X **if not already read this session**".

### Batched-read rule

When an agent's runbook lists several preparatory `read_file` calls (e.g.
"1. Read SKILL.md X / 2. Read SKILL.md Y / 3. Read template Z"), issue them
in a single parallel tool batch. One round-trip × N files is ~5–10× cheaper
than N sequential turns because each turn replays the entire prior context.

### Prefer targeted search over semantic search

When you need to locate a known symbol, file path, or exact phrase,
prefer `grep_search` (exact / regex) and bounded `read_file` ranges over
`semantic_search`. Semantic search returns a wider, less predictable
result set and inflates context. Reserve `semantic_search` for genuinely
exploratory work where you do not yet know what to search for.

### Batched-question rule

When an agent gathers structured input via `askQuestions`, group questions
that have **no data dependency** on each other into a single batched
invocation (the `questions[]` array supports this natively). Each call =
one full system-prompt replay; merging 10 independent questions into 1
batch saves ~9 turns × ~60k baseline ≈ ~540k tokens.

Only split into separate calls when a later question's content (label,
options, multiSelect) genuinely depends on a prior answer.

### Frontmatter `description` length

Keep `description:` ≤ 300 chars for both agents and skills. The Copilot
router matches on the *trigger keywords* in the description; long anti-
scope language (`USE FOR:` / `DO NOT USE FOR:` / `INVOKES:` lists)
duplicates content that already lives in the agent or SKILL body and is
not needed for routing. Putting it in the description costs tokens on
every model call.

If anti-scope clarity matters for routing of close-cousin skills
(e.g. `azure-prepare` vs `azure-cloud-migrate`), keep the `WHEN:` trigger
keywords and a single short anti-scope clause; move the full table into
the body.

### User-scope customization bloat (advisory)

VS Code Copilot **merges workspace agents/skills with user-scope and
extension-bundled ones**. In a typical dev container that includes the
Cosmos DB extension, GitHub PR extension, AI Toolkit, and similar, the
discovery layer injects 10–15 unrelated agents/skills into every system
prompt (~10–15k baseline tokens per turn).

**Repo-level mitigations now in place** (see
[`site/src/content/docs/guides/devcontainer-hygiene.md`](../../site/src/content/docs/guides/devcontainer-hygiene.md) for
the full rationale + per-developer cleanup checklist):

- `.vscode/settings.json` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` disable
  user-scope discovery (`chat.instructionsFilesLocations` /
  `chat.agentFilesLocations` / `chat.agentSkillsLocations` with
  user-profile paths set to `false`) — workspace-scoped suppression of
  `~/.copilot/*` and `~/.claude/*`.
- `.vscode/extensions.json` `unwantedRecommendations` flags three heavy
  Copilot-bloat extensions for one-click uninstall when this workspace
  is opened.
- `npm run validate:extension-bloat` (wired into `validate:_node` and
  `validate:_node-ci`) rejects PR additions of denylisted extensions to
  the dev-container `extensions[]`.

What the repo **cannot** suppress: extension-contributed
`chatSkills` / `chatAgents` / `chatPromptFiles` register via the
extension contribution API, not file paths. The only durable removal is
to not have the extension installed. The per-developer checklist in
[`site/src/content/docs/guides/devcontainer-hygiene.md`](../../site/src/content/docs/guides/devcontainer-hygiene.md)
covers `code --uninstall-extension` and host user-profile prompts-folder
cleanup.

This advisory is informational. Do not modify a contributor's dev
container or user-scope settings as part of an agent change beyond the
workspace-level mitigations already in place.

### No-direct-markdownlint-on-agent-output rule

Agents must **never** invoke `markdownlint-cli2 agent-output/...` (or
any equivalent direct lint invocation against an `agent-output/**`
path) from a tool span. The path is already excluded from
`npm run lint:md` at
[`.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`](../../.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc) (global
`ignores` list), and the artifact contract is enforced by the
[`lefthook.yml`](../../lefthook.yml) `artifact-validation` pre-commit
hook (which runs `npm run validate:artifacts` on staged
`agent-output/**/*.md`) plus the
[`10-Challenger`](../agents/10-challenger.agent.md) review step.
Improvising a direct lint call wastes the user's context budget on
work the pipeline already does, and `validate-agents` will fail the
build if an agent body documents the forbidden invocation.

Equivalent prohibition for `npm run lint:md` and
`npm run lint:artifact-templates` against `agent-output/**`: do not
invoke either from inside an agent body. Delegate to pre-commit + CI.

### Execution-subagent invocation contract

When a parent agent calls `runSubagent` for an execution-style
subagent (validate, what-if, plan, policy-precheck, cost-estimate,
challenger-review), the `prompt` string MUST follow the three-H2
shape declared at
[`tools/apex-prompts/utility-prompts/execution-subagent.prompt.md`](../../tools/apex-prompts/utility-prompts/execution-subagent.prompt.md):

1. `## Inputs` — what the parent needs (≤ 4 sentences).
2. `## Activities` — exact bash / tool steps to run.
3. `## Outputs` — schema name, verdict enum, or bounded markdown
   summary; include the failure mode.

This contract is documented in the template above. It targets the
runtime prompt string, not the subagent body. The structural
guardrail (`tests/scripts/test_execution_subagent_contract.mjs`)
enforces that the template file itself remains intact.

### No-shell-writes-to-agent-output rule

Agents and subagents must **never** write to `agent-output/**` via
shell heredocs, `>`/`>>` redirects, or `tee`. All artifact writes
(including JSON sidecars such as `06-policy-precheck.json`,
`05-cost-estimate.json`, `06-bicep-whatif.json`) go through the
file-editing tools (`create_file`, `replace_string_in_file`,
`multi_replace_string_in_file`). Read-only inspection
(`ls`/`cat`/`wc -l`) is fine. Enforced by `tools/scripts/safe-shell.mjs`
via the `agent-output-no-heredoc` rule; details in
[`no-heredoc.instructions.md`](no-heredoc.instructions.md).

### Challenger-subagent fallback rule

`runSubagent { agentName: "challenger-review-subagent" }` has been
observed at runtime to fail with `Error invoking subagent: Requested
agent 'challenger-review-subagent' not found.` even when the
parent + subagent config matches the VS Code subagent docs
(<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/subagents>) and
`npm run validate:agents` passes. Verified once on
`tmp/agent-debug-log-a3ca0888-f43d-4ab4-b06d-6d289a194942.json`
span #361.

Root cause uncertain. Candidates: session-cache staleness in VS Code's
agent discovery, an experimental-feature edge case
(`chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled` is experimental per the docs),
or an undocumented naming/location constraint. **Do not** describe
this as a "known VS Code glitch" in agent bodies until either a public
upstream issue or a deterministic repro confirms the cause.

Fallback (parent agents that delegate to `challenger-review-subagent`):

1. Retry once via the `10-Challenger` user-invocable wrapper agent
   ([`.github/agents/10-challenger.agent.md`](../agents/10-challenger.agent.md)).
   It exists specifically as the standalone path-to-artifact wrapper
   that delegates to `challenger-review-subagent`, and it is the
   pre-declared auto-handoff target in every parent agent's frontmatter
   (`agent: 10-Challenger`, `send: true`). This route is
   `user-invocable: true` and avoids the failing model-driven
   `runSubagent { agentName: "challenger-review-subagent" }` code path.
2. If `10-Challenger` also fails, surface the verbatim runtime error
   to the user and **stop**. Never improvise an inline "autonomous
   review pass" in the parent's context window — that doubles
   input-token cost (~100–150k extra per Step 1, measured on log
   a3ca0888) and produces findings indistinguishable from a real
   subagent result. The validator cannot detect such inline
   fabrication structurally.

Validator coverage of this rule is structural only — `validate-agents`
verifies the parent's `agents:` declaration matches the subagent name,
but cannot detect runtime resolution failures.

## Decision Logging

When you make a significant choice during your workflow step, append an entry to
the `decision_log` array in `00-session-state.json`.

### When to Log

Log decisions about: architecture pattern, SKU or tier selection, deployment
strategy, IaC tool choice, security approach, networking topology, or when you
reject a viable alternative with meaningful trade-offs.

Do NOT log: minor implementation details, formatting choices, file naming, or
decisions already captured in the `decisions` object fields.

### Entry Format

```json
{
  "id": "D001",
  "step": 2,
  "agent": "03-Architect",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-13T15:10:00Z",
  "title": "B1 App Service over Container Apps",
  "choice": "App Service Plan B1 (Linux)",
  "alternatives": ["Container Apps Consumption", "AKS"],
  "rationale": "Budget < EUR1000/mo; no container expertise; B1 meets 200 concurrent users NFR",
  "impact": "No container registry needed; simplifies deployment"
}
```

**Required fields**: `id`, `step`, `agent`, `title`, `choice`, `rationale`.
Use sequential IDs (`D001`, `D002`, ...) continuing from the last entry.
Set `timestamp` to the current ISO 8601 time. `alternatives` and `impact` are
optional but encouraged when rejecting a viable option.

## Model-Prompt Alignment

When creating or modifying an agent definition (`.agent.md`) or prompt file (`.prompt.md`),
apply the patterns below based on the `model:` field in the file's YAML frontmatter.

### Model Detection

Read the `model:` field from frontmatter and classify:

- **Claude family**: any value containing `Claude Opus`, `Claude Sonnet`, or `Claude Haiku`
- **GPT family**: any value containing `GPT-5.5`, `GPT-5.4`, `GPT-5.3-Codex`, or `GPT-4o`

If `model:` is an array, classify by the first entry.

#### XML Blocks (selective — not every agent)

Add XML blocks only where they serve the agent's actual role. Each block should
be 3-5 lines. Place them after the first `#` heading, before the body content.

| Block                            | Add when                                                                  | Do NOT add when                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<investigate_before_answering>` | Agent researches before deciding (Architect, Planners, Context Optimizer) | ONE-SHOT agents (Requirements), procedural wrappers (lint subagents) |
| `<output_contract>`              | Agent produces a formal artifact with defined structure                   | Agent has no structured output                                       |
| `<context_awareness>`            | Agent definition exceeds ~350 lines                                       | Small agents, subagents                                              |
| `<scope_fencing>`                | Agent produces scoped artifacts where creep is a risk                     | Agents whose job is comprehensive analysis (Architect)               |
| `<empty_result_recovery>`        | Agent queries Azure APIs that may return empty results                    | Agents that don't call external APIs                                 |
| `<subagent_budget>`              | Agent orchestrates 3+ subagents                                           | Leaf agents that don't delegate                                      |

**Never add**: `<use_parallel_tool_calls>` (Claude does this natively),
`<avoid_overengineering>` on comprehensive-analysis agents.

#### Language Calibration

- Keep absolute language (`MUST`, `NEVER`, `HARD RULE`) at: approval gates,
  security baseline (TLS/HTTPS/MI), governance compliance, ONE-SHOT gates
- Prefer direct phrasing elsewhere: "Do X" instead of "You MUST always do X"
- Remove duplicate emphasis where adjacent prose already conveys the same rule

### GPT-Specific Patterns

Sources: OpenAI prompt engineering documentation, GPT-5.5 system prompt guidance.

#### Structure Over XML

GPT models follow markdown structure natively — use it instead of XML blocks:

- `##` headings for workflow phases and major sections
- Numbered lists for sequential steps (GPT excels at step-following)
- Tables for decision matrices and option comparisons
- Bold (`**text**`) for emphasis the model should not skip

#### Tool-Call-First Phrasing

Write instructions that lead with the action:

```markdown
Use `az account show` to verify authentication before proceeding.
```

Not: "Consider checking if the user is authenticated by possibly running..."

#### Structured Output Guidance

For agents with formal outputs, use a fenced code block showing the expected format
rather than an XML `<output_contract>`. GPT models reproduce fenced examples reliably.

### Cross-Model Rules (Always Apply)

#### Handoff Model Overrides

- **Do not** add `model:` to a handoff entry unless it intentionally routes to a
  different model than the target agent's own frontmatter declares.
- Redundant overrides (matching the target's model) become stale when models change —
  remove them.

#### Handoff Prompt Enrichment

Every handoff prompt should include:

1. **Input**: which artifact the target agent should read (with path pattern)
2. **Output**: what the target agent should produce

Example: `"Create a WAF assessment based on agent-output/{project}/01-requirements.md.
Output: 02-architecture-assessment.md and 03-des-cost-estimate.md."`

#### Prompt File Model Sync

The `model:` field in a `.prompt.md` file must match the corresponding agent's
frontmatter `model:` value. If the agent uses `GPT-5.5`, the prompt must too.

Run `npm run lint:model-alignment` to catch mismatches.

#### Few-Shot Examples

For agents making routing or scoring decisions, add one structured example
in `<example>` tags (Claude) or a fenced block (GPT) showing:

- Input state
- Decision logic
- Expected output format

Keep examples under 12 lines. Place them at the end of the agent body.
