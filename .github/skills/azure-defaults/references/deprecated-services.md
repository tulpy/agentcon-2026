# Deprecated Azure Services (Do NOT Recommend for Greenfield)

> Loaded by `azure-defaults` SKILL.md when the agent encounters a service
> that may be deprecated or facing retirement. Keep the deprecation list
> here so the SKILL.md "Quick Reference" stays compact.

| Deprecated Service     | Replacement                      | Retires/EOL | Notes                         |

**Rule**: Never recommend deprecated services for greenfield projects. Before recommending
any service with a multi-year RI commitment, verify the service retirement timeline extends
beyond the commitment period. Check Microsoft Learn deprecation announcements.
