# Project-Wide Dependency-Aware Review

<investigate_before_answering>
This is a multi-domain audit. Cross-domain edges (prompt→agent, agent→skill,
script→npm-script→hook→CI, instruction→validator→rule registry) are easy to
break silently. Before proposing ANY change, confirm:

- The transient review-index has been built (Phase 0).
- The persistent review-plan (`review-plan.md`) has been created (Phase 0)
  and is current with this session's progress.
- For every finding, both upstream producers AND downstream consumers are listed.
- The user has approved the gate before moving to the next phase.

If review-index is missing or stale, re-build it. Do not infer edges from memory.
If review-plan.md is missing, create it before doing anything else — a fresh
chat must be able to resume from `review-plan.md` + `review-index.json` +
`apex-recall show` alone.

<context>
This repo is APEX (Azure Agentic Platform Engineering eXperience). It contains:

- Custom agents and subagents under `.github/agents/`
- Skills under `.github/skills/`
- Instructions under `.github/instructions/`
- Prompts under `.github/prompts/` and `tools/tests/prompts/`
- IaC under `infra/bicep/` and `infra/terraform/`
- MCP servers under `tools/mcp-servers/`
- Validators under `tools/scripts/`
- Tests under `tools/tests/`
- Astro docs site under `site/`
- Registries: `tools/registry/agent-registry.json`,
  `tools/registry/count-manifest.json`,
  `.github/model-catalog.json`,
  `.github/skills/vendor-prompting/rules.json`,
  `.github/skills/workflow-engine/templates/workflow-graph.json`
- Pre-commit + pre-push hooks via `lefthook.yml`

The project conventions and validation matrix live in `AGENTS.md`,
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and the per-folder `AGENTS.md` files.

Read these orientation files BEFORE Phase 0:

- `AGENTS.md` (root project conventions)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Copilot orchestration)
- `tools/registry/agent-registry.json` (agent inventory)
- `tools/registry/count-manifest.json` (entity counts; do NOT hard-code)
- `.github/skills/workflow-engine/templates/workflow-graph.json` (DAG)
- `lefthook.yml` (pre-commit / pre-push wiring)
- `package.json` (npm script catalog)

`{review_id}` for output paths in this prompt is the timestamped review folder
(see Phase 0 for the path; format: `review-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`).
</context>

<task>
Run the phases below in order. Stop at every gate; require user approval
before advancing. Do NOT batch phases.

## Resume vs. fresh start

Before Phase 0, check whether a review is already in progress:

```bash
ls -1 agent-output/_baselines/ 2>/dev/null | grep '^review-' | tail -1
```

If the most recent `review-*/review-plan.md` exists and its Phase Status
table has any row that is not `completed`:

1. **Resume that review.** Read `review-plan.md` end-to-end, then
   `review-index.json`, then `apex-recall show {review_id} --json`.
2. Pick the first non-completed phase and continue from there.
3. Do NOT create a new `{review_id}` and do NOT rebuild the index unless
   it is missing or the user explicitly asks for a fresh start.
4. Confirm the resume to the user with: phase about to run, last hot-fix
   timestamp, count of open findings.

Otherwise (no plan, all phases completed, or user requests a new sweep):
start at Phase 0 with a fresh `{review_id}`.

## Argument-hint scoping

If the user supplied a single-domain `argument-hint` (e.g. `validators`,
`registries`, `agents`, `skills`, `instructions`, `prompts`, `iac`, `mcp`,
`site`, `tests`), still run **Phase 0** (build the index), then jump
directly to the matching phase, then to **Phase 11** (master report
scoped to the chosen domain). Skip the other phases entirely — do not
run them silently.

If the hint is `all` or absent, run every phase in order.

## Phase 0 — Build the transient review-index

Goal: produce one JSON file that the rest of the review reads instead of
re-reading every body. This is the "knowledge graph" for this session.

1. Choose `{review_id} = review-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`. Create
   `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/`. Use that as the output folder.
2. Initialise apex-recall for the review session so checkpoints work:

   ```bash
   apex-recall init {review_id} --json   # if a session already exists, capture its state via `apex-recall show {review_id} --json` instead
   ```

3. Aggregate into `review-index.json`:
   - `agents[]` — from `tools/registry/agent-registry.json` plus parsed
     frontmatter (name, model, family, body_lines, declared skills,
     handoffs).
   - `subagents[]` — same shape, scoped to `_subagents/`.
   - `skills[]` — directory walk of `.github/skills/`; capture
     `description`, `applyTo`-style usage, and which agents reference
     each skill (via `agent-registry.json` + grep for `Read .github/skills/`).
   - `instructions[]` — directory walk of `.github/instructions/`;
     capture `applyTo` glob and any cross-references to other
     instructions, skills, or scripts.
   - `prompts[]` — both `.github/prompts/` and `tools/tests/prompts/`;
     capture frontmatter (`agent`, `model`, `description`) and the
     resolved effective family.
   - `validators[]` — every `tools/scripts/validate-*.mjs` and
     `lint-*.mjs`; for each, capture the file globs it walks and the
     rule IDs it emits (grep for `ruleId:` strings).
   - `npm_scripts[]` — every entry in `package.json` `scripts`; resolve
     each to the underlying script file and the validators it invokes.
   - `hooks[]` — pre-commit and pre-push entries from `lefthook.yml`,
     each with the npm script(s) it runs.
   - `ci_workflows[]` — every `.github/workflows/*.yml` and the npm
     scripts each job runs.
   - `iac_projects[]` — directories under `infra/bicep/` and
     `infra/terraform/` with their `azure.yaml` (when present) and the
     AVM modules they reference.
   - `mcp_servers[]` — directories under `tools/mcp-servers/` with
     entry points and dependent npm/python packages.
   - `site_pages[]` — files under `site/src/content/docs/` with their
     `astro.config.mjs` sidebar position.
4. Compute cross-domain edges:
   - prompt → agent → skill → instruction
   - validator → rule registry (`vendor-prompting/rules.json`)
   - npm script → script file → validator(s) → hook(s) → CI workflow(s)
   - skill → consuming agents (reverse index)
   - instruction `applyTo` → file globs that match
5. Save `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/review-index.json`.
6. Save a one-page human summary at `review-index-summary.md` with
   counts and any orphans detected (skills not read by any agent,
   validators not wired to npm scripts, etc.).
7. Create the **persistent project plan** at
   `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/review-plan.md`. This file is
   the single source of truth across phases and across chat sessions.
   It MUST contain:
   - **Resume instructions** (how a fresh chat picks up the work).
   - **Phase status table** (one row per phase 0–11 with `not-started` /
     `in-progress` / `paused` / `completed` / `blocked`, started/completed
     timestamps, gate name, link to domain report).
   - **Scope decision** captured at Gate 0.
   - **Counts snapshot** from `review-index.json` (refresh on rebuild).
   - **Open findings table** (id, phase, severity, status, title, file,
     resolution). Severities: `blocker` / `high` / `medium` / `low` /
     `info`. Statuses: `open` / `in-progress` / `fixed` / `deferred` /
     `accepted`.
   - **Deferred-findings sub-table** (cosmetic / opt-in items).
   - **Hot-fix log** (timestamp, finding id, file, verification command).
   - **Decisions log** (timestamp, decision, rationale).
   - **Artifacts index** (one row per expected output file).
   - **Maintenance protocol** (start-of-phase, at-gate, on-approval,
     on-hot-fix, on-scope-change — see template below).
8. **Gate 0**: present counts, top-5 orphans, and ask the user for
   the review scope (full / single domain / specific files).

## Phase 1 — Validators & enforcement infrastructure

Order matters: validators are upstream of every other domain. If a
validator is broken, all downstream findings are unreliable.

For each `tools/scripts/validate-*.mjs` and `lint-*.mjs`:

1. Confirm it is wired into `package.json` and into `lefthook.yml`
   (pre-commit or pre-push) and into a CI workflow. List orphans.
2. Confirm its rule IDs (when applicable) match the registries:
   `vendor-prompting/rules.json`, schemas under `tools/schemas/`.
3. Run it once, capture pass/fail.
4. Identify each validator's blast radius — i.e., which files it
   guards. Save to the domain report.

Domain report: `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/01-validators.md`.

**Gate 1**: present orphan/broken-validator findings; ask before fixing.

## Phase 2 — Registries & schemas

Sources of truth:

- `tools/registry/agent-registry.json` (+ schema)
- `tools/registry/count-manifest.json` (+ generator script)
- `tools/registry/source-freshness.json`
- `.github/model-catalog.json` (+ generator)
- `.github/skills/vendor-prompting/rules.json`
- `.github/skills/workflow-engine/templates/workflow-graph.json`
- `tools/schemas/*.schema.json`

For each registry: confirm schema, compute the regenerated form
**in memory only** (do NOT stage or write the regenerated file), diff
against the committed version, and list dependents that read from it
via the review-index.

Gate 2 records any drift; the user approves any subsequent regeneration
as a separate post-review action — not part of this read-only sweep.

Domain report: `02-registries.md`.

**Gate 2**: surface drift between computed and committed registry forms;
implementation of regeneration (which mutates files) is deferred until
the Phase 11 master report is approved.

## Phase 3 — Workflow graph + agents + subagents

Order: workflow-graph → agents → subagents (subagents are leaves).

1. Validate the DAG (`validate-workflow-graph.mjs`) and the workflow
   table sync (`lint:workflow-table-sync`).
2. For every agent:
   - Frontmatter health (vendor-prompting rules from prior sweep).
   - Body alignment with vendor (Claude XML idioms / GPT-5.5
     skeleton, per family in the review-index).
   - Handoff coverage: every handoff target exists; every handoff
     prompt has input + output references (`handoff-enrichment-001`).
   - Skill usage: every declared skill exists; every skill the body
     reads is declared.
3. For every subagent: `user-invocable: false`, no leaks of
   personality blocks, body matches family conventions.

Domain report: `03-agents.md`. Include a table of "agents that
share skills" and "agents whose handoffs depend on each other" so
upstream impact is explicit.

**Gate 3**: any rename / deletion proposal must list every dependent
in the review-index before approval.

## Phase 4 — Skills & instructions

Order: skills upstream of agents (skills are libraries); instructions
upstream of skills (instructions define authoring contracts).

1. For every instruction file: `applyTo` glob matches real files;
   description is non-empty; cross-references resolve.
2. For every skill: `SKILL.md` size ≤ MAX_SKILL_LINES_WITHOUT_REFS
   (or has a `references/` directory); `description` triggers
   correctly; the agent definitions referencing the skill load
   `SKILL.md` (the only tier).
3. Detect orphan skills (no agent references) and orphan instructions
   (`applyTo` matches no file).

Domain report: `04-skills-instructions.md`.

**Gate 4**: orphan removals require user approval (could be deferred
work, not garbage).

## Phase 5 — Prompts

Per the prior alignment sweep, prompts that target a custom agent
must NOT declare `model:`; generic prompts MUST. Verify and report.

Domain report: `05-prompts.md`.

**Gate 5**: any `model:` rule violations are HARD errors.

## Phase 6 — IaC

If no project subdirectories exist under `infra/bicep/` or
`infra/terraform/` (only `AGENTS.md` and `.gitkeep` present), record
"No IaC projects detected; skipping per-project checks" and run only
step 4 below.

For each project under `infra/bicep/` and `infra/terraform/`:

1. Run `bicep build` + `bicep lint` OR `terraform fmt -check` +
   `terraform validate`.
2. Confirm AVM-first compliance (raw resources flagged).
3. Confirm the `azure.yaml` exists and points at the right
   `infra/{tool}/{project}/` path.
4. Run `npm run validate:iac-security-baseline`.

Domain report: `06-iac.md`.

**Gate 6**: any security-baseline violation is a HARD error.

## Phase 7 — MCP servers & ad-hoc tooling

For each `tools/mcp-servers/<server>/`:

1. Confirm tests pass.
2. Confirm wired into `.vscode/mcp.json` (or documented as standalone).
3. Confirm package version matches `pyproject.toml` / `package.json`.

Domain report: `07-mcp.md`.

## Phase 8 — Site (Astro docs)

1. Confirm `astro.config.mjs` sidebar matches `site/src/content/docs/`
   tree.
2. Run `npm run docs:build` to detect broken refs.
3. Confirm count-driven pages (e.g., agent count) read from
   `count-manifest.json` instead of hard-coded numbers.
4. Cross-check key claims against the review-index (number of agents,
   skills, validators).

Domain report: `08-site.md`.

## Phase 9 — Tests & CI hooks

1. List every test under `tools/tests/`. Confirm each is invoked by
   an npm script + by lefthook or a CI workflow.
2. Run the test suites that are scoped to the changes.
3. Verify the `lefthook.yml` `parallel: false` invariant still holds
   (read `lefthook.yml` directly — the file's leading comment
   documents why parallel execution is unsafe).

Domain report: `09-tests-ci.md`.

## Phase 10 — Cross-domain consistency

Use the review-index to detect issues no single-domain pass can find:

- A prompt referencing an agent that no longer exists.
- An agent declaring a skill that no agent registry entry includes.
- A validator emitting a rule ID not in any registry.
- An npm script that no hook or workflow runs.
- A site doc page citing a count that drifts from `count-manifest.json`.
- An instruction file with `applyTo` matching files that no other
  domain references.

Domain report: `10-cross-domain.md`.

## Phase 11 — Master report

Aggregate all per-domain reports into:

- `00-master-review.md` — executive summary, top-N blockers,
  recommended action plan with explicit upstream/downstream notes.
- `00-action-plan.md` — every recommended fix with: blast radius,
  dependents from the review-index, severity (blocker / high / medium
  / low / info), estimated effort.

**Final gate**: user reviews master report; chooses which fixes to
implement (or defers everything to follow-up sweeps).
</task>

<rules>
- Do NOT modify any file in Phases 0–10. Phases produce findings and
  domain reports only. Implementation happens after the final gate
  approves an action plan. Exception: user-approved hot-fixes between
  gates — these MUST be logged in `review-plan.md` Hot-Fix Log before
  the edit tool is called.
- Always use `tools/registry/count-manifest.json` for counts; never
  hard-code.
- Use the review-index as the dependency map. If a phase cannot find
  a dependent in the index, re-run Phase 0 — do NOT guess.
- Stop at every gate. Do not chain phases.
- **Maintain `review-plan.md` continuously**. Update it:
  - At the start of every phase (mark phase `in-progress`, set started
    timestamp).
  - At every gate (append findings, gate question, decision).
  - On every user approval (mark phase `completed`, set completed
    timestamp, advance to next phase row).
  - On every hot-fix (Hot-Fix Log row + finding status flip BEFORE the
    edit tool runs).
  - On every scope change (Decisions Log row + paused-phase markers).
  A fresh chat must be able to resume from `review-plan.md` +
  `review-index.json` + `apex-recall show` alone.
- Use `apex-recall` as a secondary checkpoint. Use `finding` (not
  `checkpoint`, which only accepts workflow step keys 1–7) to log
  phase-level summaries:
  `apex-recall finding {review_id} --add "<one-line summary>" --json`
- Defer cosmetic/style issues (e.g., handoff-enrichment baseline,
  density-rule info-level findings) to a separate sweep unless the
  user explicitly opts in. Capture them in the Deferred sub-table of
  `review-plan.md`.
- For every finding, include: file path with line number, rule or
  invariant violated, upstream producers, downstream consumers,
  severity, suggested fix.
- After any hot-fix that changes the structural inventory (new files,
  deleted entities, renamed registry entries), regenerate
  `review-index.json` and refresh the Counts Snapshot in
  `review-plan.md`.
</rules>

<output_contract>

- `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/review-index.json` —
  transient dependency map (Phase 0).
- `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/review-index-summary.md` —
  human-readable counts + orphans (Phase 0).
- `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/review-plan.md` —
  **persistent project plan** (created in Phase 0, updated at every
  phase transition, gate, hot-fix, and scope change). Single source of
  truth across chat sessions.
- `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/0{N}-{domain}.md` — one
  domain report per phase 1–10.
- `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/00-master-review.md` —
  executive summary.
- `agent-output/_baselines/{review_id}/00-action-plan.md` —
  prioritized fix list with blast-radius notes.

Final chat output to user: artifact paths + top-5 blockers, no
embedded artifact bodies. Always paths.
