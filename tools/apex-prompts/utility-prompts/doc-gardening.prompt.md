# Doc Gardening

Scan the repository for entropy and update health metrics. All counts cited in outputs
must come from `tools/registry/count-manifest.json` — never hard-code numbers.

<investigate_before_answering>

- Doc gardening is investigative work. Before producing recommendations,
  confirm that the source-of-truth files exist (see Pre-flight) and that
  the user wants a full sweep vs. a single area (freshness, drift, counts,
  explorer graph, quality score, or tech-debt).
- If freshness baseline (`freshness-report.json`) is missing, note that the
  first run will create it and flag files relative to current mtime only.
  </investigate_before_answering>

<context>
- Required source-of-truth files: `QUALITY_SCORE.md`,
  `tools/tests/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`,
  `tools/registry/count-manifest.json`. Optional:
  `freshness-report.json`.
- Validators run by this prompt:
  `tools/scripts/check-docs-freshness.mjs`,
  `tools/scripts/validate-instruction-checks.mjs`,
  `tools/scripts/validate-no-deprecated-refs.mjs`,
  `tools/scripts/validate-skills.mjs`,
  `tools/scripts/validate-agents.mjs`,
  `tools/scripts/validate-no-hardcoded-counts.mjs`.
- Architecture Explorer graph at
  `site/public/architecture-explorer-graph.json` is regenerated via
  `npm run build:explorer-graph`.
</context>

<task>
Execute the seven gardening tasks in the Tasks section, in order. Stop and
ask if any required source-of-truth file is missing (do not create
silently). Produce the outputs listed below.
</task>

<rules>
- Do NOT hard-code counts in any output — reference
  `tools/registry/count-manifest.json`.
- Do NOT silently create missing source-of-truth files; ask the user.
- Validator runs are read-only — do not auto-fix findings (just report).
- Quality-score and tech-debt updates require human review of each change.
</rules>

<output_contract>

- Updated `QUALITY_SCORE.md` with revised grades and change-log entries.
- Updated `tools/tests/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md` with new and
  resolved items.
- Summary report to the user covering: freshness diff totals,
  count-manifest conflicts (if any), explorer-graph staleness status,
  validator results, and prioritised follow-ups.
  </output_contract>

## Pre-flight

Before running tasks, verify target files exist. If any of the following are missing,
stop and ask the user (do not create them silently):

- `QUALITY_SCORE.md`
- `tools/tests/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`
- `tools/registry/count-manifest.json`
- `freshness-report.json` (optional — first-run gardening will create it)

## Tasks

1. **Stale documentation** — run `node tools/scripts/check-docs-freshness.mjs` and flag files
   not updated in >90 days. Diff the resulting `freshness-report.json` against the
   previous committed version (if any) and summarise files that became stale, were
   refreshed, or were added since the last run.

2. **Instruction/skill drift** — run `node tools/scripts/validate-instruction-checks.mjs` to
   find orphaned references from deleted/renamed instructions, plus
   `node tools/scripts/validate-no-deprecated-refs.mjs` to catch stale script/module refs.

3. **Cross-reference integrity** — run `node tools/scripts/validate-skills.mjs` (covers format
   and size; replaces the historical `validate-skills-format.mjs`) and
   `node tools/scripts/validate-agents.mjs` (covers frontmatter; replaces the historical
   `validate-agent-frontmatter.mjs`).

4. **Count-manifest alignment** — run `node tools/scripts/validate-no-hardcoded-counts.mjs`.
   Additionally, scan `site/src/content/docs/**/*.{md,mdx}`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
   and `QUALITY_SCORE.md` for numeric entity counts (e.g., "15 agents", "41 skills")
   that conflict with `count-manifest.json` computed values. Report each conflict with
   the exact file + line.

5. **Architecture Explorer graph freshness** — if
   `site/public/architecture-explorer-graph.json` exists, compare its `generatedAt`
   timestamp (or file mtime as fallback) against the newest mtime across
   `.github/agents/**`, `.github/agents/_subagents/**`, `.github/skills/**`,
   `.github/instructions/**`, `.github/prompts/**`, `.vscode/mcp.json`,
   `tools/registry/agent-registry.json`. Flag as stale if any
   source is newer than the graph. Recommend running `npm run build:explorer-graph`.

6. **Quality score review** — read `QUALITY_SCORE.md`, compare grades against current
   state, propose updates.

7. **Tech debt inventory** — read `tools/tests/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`, verify items
   still relevant, add new discoveries.

## Output

- Update `QUALITY_SCORE.md` with revised grades and change log entries.
- Update `tools/tests/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md` with new/resolved items.
- Report a summary to the user including: freshness diff totals, count-manifest
  conflicts (if any), explorer graph staleness status, and prioritised follow-ups.
- Do NOT hard-code counts in any output — reference `tools/registry/count-manifest.json`.
